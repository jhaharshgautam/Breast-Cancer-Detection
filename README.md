# Breast Cancer Detection  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project implements a **Breast Cancer Detection system** using **Machine Learning** techniques. The goal is to classify whether a tumor is **malignant** or **benign** based on diagnostic features from medical data.  

As a fresher in Computer Science, this project helped me strengthen my skills in **Python, data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation**, while applying concepts of supervised learning to a real-world healthcare dataset.

## 🚀 Features  
- Data preprocessing: cleaning, scaling, and preparing the dataset.  
- Model building with **Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, SVM, and Random Forest**.  
- Performance evaluation using **accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix**.  
- Comparative analysis of different ML models.  
- Beginner-friendly codebase for learning and experimentation.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Dataset:** Breast Cancer Wisconsin Diagnostic dataset  

---

## 📊 Results  
- Achieved up to **92% accuracy** with Random Forest.  
- Identified the most effective algorithm for early breast cancer detection.  
- Demonstrated how ML can assist in real-world medical diagnostics.
