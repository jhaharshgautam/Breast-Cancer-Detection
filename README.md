# Breast-Cancer-Detection
ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project implements a Breast Cancer Detection system using Machine Learning techniques. The goal is to classify whether a tumor is malignant or benign based on diagnostic features from medical data.

As a fresher in Computer Science, this project helped me strengthen my skills in Python, data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation, while applying concepts of supervised learning to a real-world healthcare dataset.
